# Direct Moutamadris

Nobody likes to use the clunky massar service website, not to mention when the servers are overloaded, this is a simple web app (scraper for legal reasons not) to fetch your grade data directly.

# Demo
(Cloud hosted providers won't work due to the fact that you can only use the site in morocco)
- [Demo that may or may not be online](http://moutamadris.hopto.org/)
  

# Run locally
